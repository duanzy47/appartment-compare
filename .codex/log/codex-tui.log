+# Seloger Favorites Toolkit Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### Test-Driven & Green-to-Commit
+
+- MUST author failing automated tests before writing production code for any change.  
+- MUST block merges until the full local test suite and continuous integration both pass.  
+- MUST treat flaky or intermittently failing tests as hard failures and stabilize them before merge approval.  
+Rationale: A disciplined red-green-refactor loop keeps the Playwright automation reliable and protects the
+data export flows from regressions.
+
+### Minimalist Implementation
+
+- MUST deliver the smallest slice of functionality that satisfies the current specification.  
+- MUST avoid adding dependencies without explicit justification tied to an active requirement.  
+- MUST delete dead code, unused scripts, and obsolete configuration as soon as they lose purpose.  
+Rationale: The toolkit stays maintainable when every module earns its keep and the code surface remains small.
+
+## State & Artifact Discipline
+
+- Session state, scraped outputs, and other runtime artifacts MUST remain in `local/` or other gitignored
+paths; repository history MAY NOT include sensitive or transient data.  
+- Developers MUST document any new generated artifact paths alongside `.gitignore` updates before merging.  
+- Secrets, tokens, and third-party credentials MUST NOT leave the developer's machine; reference examples
+belong in `.env.example` only.
+
+## Delivery Workflow
+
+- Pull requests MUST demonstrate the failing test first, then the passing implementation commit(s), unless
+a single commit preserves a clear red-green narrative.  
+- Behavior changes MUST update or add tests that capture the new contract within the same pull request.  
+- Code review MUST confirm that newly added code paths have direct test coverage and that complexity is
+justified under the Minimalist Implementation principle.
+
+## Governance
+
+- Amendments require consensus from active maintainers via pull request referencing the proposed version
+and rationale; merges without consensus are invalid.  
+- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for principle or governance reversals, MINOR for new principles
+or sections, PATCH for clarifications.  
+- Compliance reviews occur at least once per quarter to audit adherence to the principles, with findings
+documented in the repository.

 ## Constitution Check
 
 *GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
 
-[Gates determined based on constitution file]
+- [ ] Identify the failing automated tests that will be written before any implementation work begins.
+- [ ] Confirm every planned behavior change includes corresponding test updates in the initial tasks.
+- [ ] Justify each new dependency or shared component; if none are required, explicitly state "No new dependencies."
+- [ ] Document how generated artifacts stay in gitignored locations (e.g., `local/`) and note any `.gitignore` updates needed.
